Car Sales Dashboard – Power BI Analytics  This project focuses on designing and developing an interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI to analyze dealership sales performance across multiple dimensions such as time, body style, color, region, and company.
The dashboard provides real-time insights into key sales KPIs including Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales, Month-to-Date (MTD) Sales, Average Price, Cars Sold, and Year-over-Year (YOY) growth. With dynamic visuals, slicers, and drill-down capabilities, stakeholders can easily identify trends, monitor performance, and make data-driven business decisions.

The solution transforms raw sales data into actionable insights by combining strong data modeling, DAX calculations, and effective visual storytelling.
